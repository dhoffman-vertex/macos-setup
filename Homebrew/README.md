# Homebrew

[Brewfile](Homebrew/Brewfile) can be applied with the following command:

```shell
brew bundle --file Brewfile
```

- [Homebrew/homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) - Similar to how Gemfiles work in Ruby for managing package lists from a file
- [rcmdnk/homebrew-file](https://homebrew-file.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - Looks like an interesting replacement for Homebrew's Bundle (Brewfile) with more features
